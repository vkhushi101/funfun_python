Hi friends!

If you're wondering what this repo is, I'm happy to give some context about the material you'll find here. 

Each directory is composed of short 1-2 hour challenges that I work on to exercise my Python skills. There's a README in each directory that consists of the problem statement and boundaries that I set for myself. 

To be transparent, for some of these nitty requirements, during implementation, I get kind of lazy, and choose to ignore/ change the specificity of the requirement.

If you have any questions about my code or want to use it for your own practice, feel free to shoot me a dm on LinkedIn.

Enjoy judging my code!
